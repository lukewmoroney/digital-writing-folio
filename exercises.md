# Digital Writing Reflections
# Week 1 (3/3)
## Initial Thoughts
<p/>I chose this class because I see the most potential to grow from it. Formulas have never been something I'm a natural at. I prefer the abstract and indefinite, so this is daunting. First lesson felt a bit chaotic, but we're all working it out. It's good to know there is a market for digital writing as well. I have some ideas that could be interesting for an audience if executed well. Right now it's just about trying not to get overwhelmed.</p><p/>Part of me wanted to bail and choose something else, but I don't want to quit. So I won't. I'd rather stick it out and push this other part of my brain to develop. That being said, it would've been nice to know how much coding is involved before I signed up, just so I could brace myself. I still don't know what the rest of term will look likeâ€”what I'll learn; if I can do it and do it well.</p><p/>I also can't decide if I'm terrified or excited. Probably both.</p>
