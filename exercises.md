To expand my ability to communicate, engaging with the reader in a new way.
### What types of writing do you do (e.g. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)?
Short-fiction, poetry.
### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
Word, pen/paper. 
Observation, ekphrasis, short-hand flow of consciousness.
### Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?
These are accessible, cost-effective tools.
### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?
Writing by hand helps me decongest ideas without initial critique. Critique comes when I edit on Word.
