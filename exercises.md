# Digital Writing Reflections
## Week One
### Digital Writing
Digital writing is any literature presented through digital mediums. This might often include interactivity, where the user is prompted to select different options to obtain a progressive outcome. Some forms remain static on the screen, while others consist of text moving around the screen. I am particularly interested in the way meaning is transformed through interactivity. I think it is important for contemporary writers to evolve with technology. I do not often interact with social media, and while there are benefits to being offline, it also presents the risk of falling out of touch with current modes of communicating in the modern era. Thus, I am eager to find new ways of engaging with an audience through digital writing.
### Your Writing
When possible, I typically write using analogue materials, such as with a pen in a pocketbook. I prefer this method for its allowance to be messy, especially when constructing poetry. When I do not have access to non-digital mediums, I will use the notes app on my iPhone, and only as a last resort do I write a first draft on my computer. Yet I find it difficult to de-clutter my thoughts using this method. I like to be on the move while I write, often crafting a poem or fiction while situated on the train, or while walking around the inner city. I adopted this practice from writers like Frank O’Hara and Jack Kerouac, trying to write without self-critiquing. Perhaps I could still use this methodology to enhance my writing through digital poetry, taking the messiness of my pocketbook notes and placing them unfiltered into a digital interface. This could be beneficial specifically because I find that often when I transfer an analogue poem to Microsoft Word, for example, it often feels like it loses its charm.
## Week Three
### Lipogram (removing e)
Coming up this mountain, I know that bird is far and almost upon us. It is that albatross. Nothing has wings that broad on Snowy Mountain. Nothing but that albatross, its vision always upon us. Its flight always toward us. Nothing but that albatross could squark that sound. Nothing so violent as that albatross.

### Glitch Reflection
Using poems written while I was living in London and visiting Paris in early January, I replaced the title panel with a part of a poem inspired by John Ashbery’s “Debit Night” (1995). Contrasting the digitisation of the poem, I recentred the image of Ashbery’s poem into nature, adding also a alpine background to reintegrate the user into nature. I also reconfigured the alert notification to feature a short non-sensical poem about a cat. I found the interactivity that the feature provided to be an enjoyable way to test the boundaries of digital poetry, before moving on to Nick Monfort's Garfield haiku. I reformatted the code to situate the user within nature once again. I also added a woodland backdrop, yet the dark, woody textures make it difficult to properly read the text. I do not see this entirely as a hinderance, however, as it perhaps signals to the reader their attention is required, much as it is required when witnessing true wilderness. The final poem I incorporated was overlain over both the text message panel and the Notes app panel. I replaced the gif with an image from the film, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, as I felt it was relevant to the poem, mirroring its playful, yet reminiscent disposition.
<p> Coding is still daunting for me. Yet, my mind is more aware to its possibilities. However, it does further provoke the question of ‘what is e-literature?’ Is it merely reliant on the perspective of the reader/intention of the author? Are such binaries too limited, hindering its potential? Should we do away with attempting these semantic definitions altogether? This is all to say I am more comfortable, yet simultaneously more uncomfortable than I was in the first week. Regardless, it is enjoyable to exercise these thought-experiments in practice. What is most interesting to me right now, as it was in the first week, is the possibility for meaning-making achieved through writer-reader interactivity. I am eager to continue exploring this in the coming weeks. </p>

## Week Five
After deliberating whether to pursue a narrative or tool-based product for my final piece, I decided that I would gain the most from crafting a hypertext story using Twine. My initial idea is situated within the drama/comedy genres. My inspirations for this piece include the TV-show Atlanta and the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and deals specifically with themes of loss and unreality. The user will be presented with multiple choices on each page, as the protagonist relives memories of their deceased father. It aims to be simultaneously tender and morose, with the user initially given two opposing binary options each time, extending later to irregular amounts of options as absurdity increases. Recurring motifs are deployed as memory-triggering sensations in the character, disrupting the user’s perception of what is, and what is not, reality. Subversion of expectations can be achieved by interrupting perceived patterns. To amplify the exploration of non-binaries, I will not name the character’s gender. This will also work to resonate with a wider range of audience members. Code functions will parallel the scene text, implementing, for example, a soft-fade up effect on the text “sun comes up”. To execute this well I need to research historical and contemporary writers who engage with themes of non-binary exploration. Understanding “if” functions is important here too, as I want the feeling of consequence to be potent. To that end, I want to find a way to remove the “back” button on Twine.

## Week Seven
I spent a significant amount of time mapping my narrative in Miro, with the intention to transfer each node to Twine once the basic draft is established. Going straight to Twine I found myself editing as I wrote. Starting in Miro allows me to craft the basic plot points of the story, as well as their subsequent consequences, without the impulse to perfect it immediately. I exceedingly like the idea of incorporating the real-world places that inspired the story initially. Using Google Maps, I began retracing my steps through Utrecht, Netherlands (where the story is set) on a pre-dawn morning when it snowed. This enhanced the feeling of nostalgia I am intending to evoke in the actions of the protagonist. Primarily, I am focused on the quality of the writing at this stage rather than the functions of the code. This feels necessary in such a text-reliant piece. I am also configuring the scents and sounds that evoke memory in the real world into the story as recurring motifs. My intention here is to produce the feeling of familiarity and repetition, as the senses appear at certain intervals in the story to trigger memories. These memories blur the user’s ability to determine what is real to the character and what is not.

## Week Eight
<p>In Insomnomania I am exploring themes of loss, memory and unreality. While the syntax of the piece is intending to be poetic, an emphasis is placed on character embodiment. This involves restraining from stating emotions, but the character’s bodily experiences of them. For example, the body heats up when it is angry; the limbs go cold when its anxious. The story is centred around an insomniac protagonist. The effects of insomnia are paralleled by the feelings of loss the protagonist is experiencing. He has come to Utrecht to gain closure on a failed past relationship, and the love interest’s eventual death. It is left ambiguous what the cause for the relationship’s end was, similar to the ambiguity of her death. The user is left to speculate whether the version of events the narrator presents them is truthful, or biased. I want to evoke in the reader the lucidity the protagonist is experiencing in his state of insomnia. I attempt to achieve this by switching between the events of the past and the reality of the present, yet even the present feels like a dreamscape.</p>
<p>Digitisation allows for increased interactivity, giving the user agency through the implementation of ergodics. At first these options appear to be dichotomic, opposing choices. Yet, as the narrative progresses, more options are offered, dissolving the illusion of binary. The withholding of information combined with these features will hopefully intrigue the user to read further. With the skeleton of the piece completed, all that is left to do is distort photographs and finalise each surrealist description.</p>
<p>The final piece will be approximately 1,500 and will include 60-70 screens. Algorithmic execution is not my forte, but the template I have produced does not require much more coding. The only trouble I can foresee will perhaps involve background image generation. If worst-comes-to-worst I will abandon the use of images, as I believe the narrative holds up on its own.</p>

## Week Ten
<p>I expected to have difficulty regarding the coding side of the criteria. This semester was the hardest semester I have experienced since first beginning the Bachelor of Arts (Creative Writing) program. Events outside of my control meant that I needed to focus my attention elsewhere and my mental health was severely impacted. I do not feel I was able to be as present as I wanted to as a result. I missed significant amounts of class time and thus course material. I found it difficult to find routine and my creative practice unfortunately suffered. I appreciate the tenderness I was met with by the tutors, but I lament the fact that I was not able to be my usual knowledge-driven self. Regardless, I enjoyed speculating ways I could adapt my already existing methodology into a digital medium. The prospect of creating an interactive fiction was exciting from the beginning, and I am proud to say I have given as much as I can towards the final product, despite it being of a lesser quality than I would expect of myself when I am mentally thriving.</p>
<p>I will carry the skills I attained in this course into future projects as I further experiment with the genres and techniques of hypertext and other forms of digital literature. Experimentation has always been of interest to me, and the digital space only expands that potential. Particularly interesting to me still is the dialogue surrounding binaries, and the various ways we as creators can break such dichotomies. But I am perhaps most excited about the possibilities for collaboration and user-reader interactivity I will explore in the future. The things I have learned in the digital literature field also open the doors to other opportunities if pursued, such a video-game development. Yet it also can extend to other media, as production companies also attempt to find new ways of innovating their product. I am here thinking of the “Bandersnatch” episode of Black Mirror, for example.</p>
