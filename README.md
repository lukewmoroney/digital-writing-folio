# Digital Writing Folio

## Author Bio
Luke Moroney is a poetry and short-fiction writer living in Naarm (Melbourne), Australia. He has previously appeared in Antithesis Journal (University of Melbourne), and Poetic Portraits anthology (RMIT). Luke is currently in his final year of a Bachelor of Arts (Creative Writing) at RMIT. His work engages with the concept of embodiment through place-based methods and ideas of human/non-human co-habitation. His latest work, Insomnomania (2025), explores memory and unreality through author-reader interactivity using the Twine digital interface. Luke’s background in Youth Work and experiences living in Frankston North informs his anti-classist methodologies.

## 500-word reflection
My experience practicing digital literature was limited at the beginning of this course. It was daunting transitioning from a primarily analogue methodology to a digital one. Yet what drew me in, and what still draws me in, are the possibilities for reader-writer dialogues in the e-literature tradition. In programs like the Blackout Poetry Tool (2020) by Jazer Chand for example, this focus on interactivity extends also to the software itself. Chand’s intention to dismantle dichotomic thinking inspired the driving themes of my final creative work. Throughout the development of Insomnomania I wanted the structure to reflect anti-binary principles. These principles influenced the surrealism of the story, yet also the choices offered to the user as they moved from two-option passages to three or one. 
<p>Mapping this work indeed proved to be difficult, as I suspected. From drafting to re-drafting to the finished product, I found that the absence of pen-to-paper impacted my capacity to enjoy the process. I also had many questions regarding the semantics of terminologies. Unravelling these questions proved to be most impactful to my craft as a writer, irrespective of e-literature. By exploring the critical dialogues of digital writing and attempting to determine the distinctions between what defines literature, video-games, e-literature, for example, I came to believe that these distinctions may not matter. We often firmly draw a divide between artistic and written expression. I now consider these divisions to be irrelevant. By relying so heavily on language categorisation we risk undermining the production and result of the work in question. I found myself feeling initially uncomfortable at the idea of adding images to my interactive fiction. Upon reflection, I realised I feared reducing the cultural standard of the work. Outdated terminologies like high and low art, for example, are leftover remnants that hold creatives back from innovative outcomes. We also shackle ourselves to classist ideologies if we rely upon them. Eventually, I decided to see the construction of the project like a work of art, giving myself the freedom to experiment across multiple mediums.</p>
<p>Lastly, I believe I chose a subject for my narrative that was too intimate for me to write safely at this time. The story is centred around an insomniac in Utrecht, who is grieving the loss (and inferred subsequent death) of his wife. I did not expect when undertaking this project that its creation would impact me so dramatically. Retrospectively, it was always a potential risk. I drew often on my experience of mourning after past relationships, while my current relationship was also experiencing disfunctions. The photographs and many descriptions included in the project were also taken first-hand from my time in Europe earlier this year, where I often experienced psychological-related insomnia. I overestimated my ability to process these events while safely writing about them in a dramatized setting. Consciously, I do not adhere to the principle that artists must suffer for their art, but I forget that I can subconsciously succumb to these romanticisations if I am unhealthy. For my own sake, and the sake of my craft, implementing self-preserving strategies will be important going forward.</p>
